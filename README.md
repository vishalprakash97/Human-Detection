# Human-Detection

* Implemented Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HoG) to extract features from gradients of grayscale images
* Trained model using k-nearest neighbor approach

**Algorithms Used:** HoG, k-NN

**Project Workflow**

1. Convert Image to greyscale
2. Calculate Gradients for each image
3. Computer HoG feature for each image
4. Classify images using 3-NN classifier# Human-Detection
